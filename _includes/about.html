                    <p>Hi there, my name is Pablo Prieto and I am a senior at
                      the City College of New York pursuing a B.E in Computer
                      Engineering. I am currently interning at NYC's HRA
                      managing the databases using mySQL and generating reports
                      and summaries for the data required. I have worked in
                      projects of all types, from data structures, algorithms,
                      software design and API's to designing logic gates for
                      semiconductors and creating latches to learn the concepts
                      behind processors. </p>
                    <p>Languages that I am proficient in include, C, C++, Java,
                      Assembly Language, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML. I am greatly efficient
                      with object oriented programming and have an interest for web and
                      app design. Currently, I am working on learning app design and have
                      already created some simple apps.</p>
